![Good Interface](https://github.com/n0180886/DGL114-Process-Portfolio/blob/main/images/good_interface.PNG?raw=true) | ![Bad Interface](https://github.com/n0180886/DGL114-Process-Portfolio/blob/main/images/bad_interface.PNG?raw=true)
 **Reason:** When entering in details regarding a specific job, the UI is easily read and can be used immediately without leaving anything unclear. Layout is simple, but effective. Everything that needs to be there is there. | **Reason:** As for navigation throughout the app, this is the home screen that you land on once the app has loaded. I believe the navigation could be larger and more contrasted to the screen to feel more 'tactile' to the user.
