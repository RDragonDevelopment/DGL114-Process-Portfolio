## **Activity 0101:**
### **App Chosen:** *Arlo Smart Home*
Good Interface | Bad Interface
---------------------- | -----------------------

 **Reason:** When entering in details regarding a specific job, the UI is easily read and can be used immediately without leaving anything unclear. Layout is simple, but effective. Everything that needs to be there is there. | **Reason:** As for navigation throughout the app, this is the home screen that you land on once the app has loaded. I believe the navigation could be larger and more contrasted to the screen to feel more 'tactile' to the user.
