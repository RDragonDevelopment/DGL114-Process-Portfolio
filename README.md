 **Reason:** When entering in details regarding a specific job, the UI is easily read and can be used immediately without leaving anything unclear. Layout is simple, but effective. Everything that needs to be there is there. | **Reason:** As for navigation throughout the app, this is the home screen that you land on once the app has loaded. I believe the navigation could be larger and more contrasted to the screen to feel more 'tactile' to the user.

 ### **What makes an app 'usable'?**
 > Nothing makes me as frustrated as when I download an app and I am immediately bombarded with ads. An app needs to be able to be utilized as intended without intrusive ads or popups, within reason if the app is free. The speed at which an app operates is a huge factor aswell. I want an app to run fast and efficiently, if an app is slow and not processing information at a reasonable speed it gives me the impression that the app was poorly developed.
 ### **What makes an app 'Intuitive'?**
 > I believe that an app could be described as 'intuitive' by not going too far outside of the general 'norms' surrounding application development. For example, most apps have a similar way to navigate the app (usually by a fixed footer or a side menu accessible by a hamburger menu). But when developers make their app more 'unique' or take a more unique approach, this can make the app much harder and more confusing to use.
### **List of 'usable' and 'intuitive' elements:**
 - Ease of navigation
 - Non-intrusive ads
 - Fast and responsive
 - Easy to read (not too busy)
 - High contrasting elements

 ### **Article Chosen:** [The Color System](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes)
 ---
 ### **What did I learn from this article?**
 > By learning about the color system used by the android system, I will have a much greater potential to create apps that are visually appealing. Not only did it introduce me into the basics of how the color system works, it also showed me several tools that I can utilize in order to generate potential color palette options.

## **App Chosen:** *Spotify*

### *List of views(activities)*
- Home
- Search
- Library

> Every other 'view' within the app is a menu/tab that is opened on top of the above views, and correspond directly to their parent view. For example, home has menus such as settings, recently played area, and suggested music. The search area is pretty obvious, and enables the user to search their database for more music to add into their library. The search area has no sub-menus except for the artist/playlists that come up after a search. And finally, the Library view has every menu/tab that corresponds with the user library; such as saved playlists, artists, albums, and podcasts.
