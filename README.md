 **Reason:** When entering in details regarding a specific job, the UI is easily read and can be used immediately without leaving anything unclear. Layout is simple, but effective. Everything that needs to be there is there. | **Reason:** As for navigation throughout the app, this is the home screen that you land on once the app has loaded. I believe the navigation could be larger and more contrasted to the screen to feel more 'tactile' to the user.

 ### **What makes an app 'usable'?**
 > Nothing makes me as frustrated as when I download an app and I am immediately bombarded with ads. An app needs to be able to be utilized as intended without intrusive ads or popups, within reason if the app is free. The speed at which an app operates is a huge factor aswell. I want an app to run fast and efficiently, if an app is slow and not processing information at a reasonable speed it gives me the impression that the app was poorly developed.
 ### **What makes an app 'Intuitive'?**
 > I believe that an app could be described as 'intuitive' by not going too far outside of the general 'norms' surrounding application development. For example, most apps have a similar way to navigate the app (usually by a fixed footer or a side menu accessible by a hamburger menu). But when developers make their app more 'unique' or take a more unique approach, this can make the app much harder and more confusing to use.
### **List of 'usable' and 'intuitive' elements:**
 - Ease of navigation
 - Non-intrusive ads
 - Fast and responsive
 - Easy to read (not too busy)
 - High contrasting elements

 ### **Article Chosen:** [The Color System](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes)
 ---
 ### **What did I learn from this article?**
 > By learning about the color system used by the android system, I will have a much greater potential to create apps that are visually appealing. Not only did it introduce me into the basics of how the color system works, it also showed me several tools that I can utilize in order to generate potential color palette options.

## **App Chosen:** *Spotify*

### *List of views(activities)*
- Home
- Search
- Library

> Every other 'view' within the app is a menu/tab that is opened on top of the above views, and correspond directly to their parent view. For example, home has menus such as settings, recently played area, and suggested music. The search area is pretty obvious, and enables the user to search their database for more music to add into their library. The search area has no sub-menus except for the artist/playlists that come up after a search. And finally, the Library view has every menu/tab that corresponds with the user library; such as saved playlists, artists, albums, and podcasts.

## **App Chosen:** *Spotify*

### *Events used:*
- onDrag()
- onTouch()

### *Events used but not discussed in ch3.1:*
> After searching the app, I was unable to have any events occur using other input events such as onLongClick(), onFocusChange(), onKey(), or onCreateSubtextMenu(). It appeared that the only inputs accepted on the spotify app are onTouch() and onDrag().

## **App Chosen:** *FaceBook*

> I would consider Facebook to be a mix of flat and hierarchical. While using the app, you are presented with a bottom bar that presents multiple actions/views of equal importance. Once you reach the account information and account settings though, this is where it changes quite drastically. Due to the sheer number of settings, customization, information and security details, there is a vast amount of hierarchy being showed. There is a main screen for 'settings' and account information, but from this page specifically you can branch into groups, pages, events, jobs, ads manager, community help, fundraisers, help center, support inbox, issue reporting, terms and policies, privacy shortcuts, etc. The other views such as the home page, groups page, marketplace, and notifications views/activities can be switched through easily and generally have one clear purpose.

> While a top-bar can be used without any actions/menus, a bottom-bar should generally only be used when your screen contains more than one action. For example, our class exercises would not suit a bottom-bar as they've primarily only used a single action. Typically, bottom bars also have a FAB, or 'Floating Action Button'. Typically a bottom bar can be very ergonomic for an end user, and as such will contain three to five top level destinations within the app.

## When is the use of dialogs appropriate?

> I've found that dialogs can have many uses. As quoted from [material.io](https://material.io/components/dialogs#usage), "Dialogs should be used for: Errors that block an appâ€™s normal operation,and Critical information that requires a specific user task, decision, or acknowledgement."

> This means they would be great options for choosing accounts to be logged in to, making decisions such as deleting, sharing, or canceling aa specific action, alerting the user, and even setting up an account/giving information to the app.

## **Activity 0801:**
<details>
<summary>Click here to show answer</summary>

## **App Chosen:** *Spotify*

---

## ***Shared Preferences***
*Store private key-value pairs like strings, numbers, and other primitive data types.*
- As far as I can tell, spotify does not have any key-value pairs stored locally.

---

## ***App-Specific Files***
*Store files in internal or external memory that only the app has permission to access.*
- Music files are app-specific, you can not download these files. They are only available within the app.

---

## ***Shared Storage***
*Store images, audio, video, and other files to be shared with other apps.*
- Album art, song name, and artist names I assume would be saved under shared storage, in the event that another app would direct you into spotify. (Snapchat has the option to use Shazam, which in return gives you an album cover, artist name, and song name linked to spotify).

---

## ***Database***
*Store private, structured data in a local database.*
- As far as I am concerned, I believe spotify would only use a local database in the event that the user wanted to 'download' the music for offline playback.

---

## ***Cloud***
*Store private or public data on the internet.*
- Music files are saved to cloud storage; along with profile settings/preferences and playlists.

## **To-Do List - Advanced Storage Strategies**

## ***Shared Preferences***
*Store private key-value pairs like strings, numbers, and other primitive data types.*
- Shared Preferences could be used to store 'theme' or settings within the app, maybe key-values such as fontSize-int, theme-dark/theme-light, etc.

---

## ***App-Specific Files***
*Store files in internal or external memory that only the app has permission to access.*
- Files could be encrypted, leaving the list visibile only within the app and unable to be read by other apps/software.

---

## ***Shared Storage***
*Store images, audio, video, and other files to be shared with other apps.*
- Notes that include media might store said data here, so that it can be shared and untilized by other apps.

---

## ***Database***
*Store private, structured data in a local database.*
- Store individual notes and meta data within a local database in order to save more information regarding the note. (Meta data)

---

## ***Cloud***
*Store private or public data on the internet.*
- Cloud storage could be used in the event that the app supports multiple device usage, so you can access your notes on different devices.
